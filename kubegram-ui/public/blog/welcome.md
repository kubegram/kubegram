# Welcome to Kubegram

We are thrilled to announce the launch of **Kubegram**, a revolutionary platform designed to simplify Kubernetes infrastructure design and deployment.

## What is Kubegram?

Kubegram is a visual infrastructure design tool that allows you to:
- **Architect Visually**: Drag and drop nodes to build your cluster.
- **Auto-Generate Code**: Get production-ready Terraform and Helm charts instantly.
- **Collaborate**: Work with your team in real-time.

## Why Kubegram?

Kubernetes is powerful, but complex. We believe that infrastructure design should be intuitive and accessible to everyone, not just seasoned DevOps engineers.

Stay tuned for more updates!
