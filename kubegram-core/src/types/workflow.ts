/**
 * Generic workflow framework types shared by BaseWorkflow and all concrete
 * workflow implementations.
 *
 * `BaseWorkflowState<Step, Status>` is the required state shape — all concrete
 * states (CodegenState, PlanState, ValidationState) must extend it. The state is
 * persisted to Redis between steps via RedisCheckpointer.
 *
 * `StepHandler<State>` is the unit of work per step — it receives the current
 * state and returns the updated state. Step handlers must be pure with respect
 * to external side effects (checkpoint + publish happen in BaseWorkflow.execute).
 *
 * `WorkflowContext` carries request-scoped identity (threadId, jobId, userId,
 * companyId) without being part of the persisted state. It is passed into
 * BaseWorkflow.execute() and available to all step handlers via closure.
